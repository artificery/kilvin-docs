## Versioning Scheme

Kilvin CMS' versioning scheme maintains the following convention: `major.minor.bug`.  When referencing the Kilvin CMS, you should always use a version description such as `1.2`, since different releases of Kilvin may include breaking changes and it will help with debugging and support.
