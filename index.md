# About Kilvin

Kilvin CMS is a content management system built on top of the [Laravel framework](https://laravel.com). The project is currently in a development state and is not ready for use in production. We do not suggest using this for live websites at this time since major architectural changes are still possible, which could break existing functionality.

## Demo

There is now a demo for developers wishing to preview Kilvin CMS. The database has been locked down so no form submissions will work.
